The final stage consists of logs that the frog can cross on, and the value pack appears after 30 seconds and adds 10 moves if obtained. 

If the user presses the start button at any time during any of the stages, they are provided with the option to resume the game (start button), or select between restart game and quit game. If the user decides to restart the game, they are brought back to the first stage (alligator stage) with reset score, lives, time and moves.

This game is beat when the user reaches the castle in the final (logs) stage. A winner screen is shown and the user is brought back to the main menu if they press any button on the controller.
